# PDF-Based-Question-Answering-System-Across-Domains
Built QA systems for financial, scientific, and biomedical PDFs using fine-tuned BERT variants (BERT, SciBERT, Bio-clinicalBERT, DistillBERT). Handled BERTâ€™s token limit by splitting documents into chunks and used curated datasets for training and evaluation. Conducted cross-domain testing to assess generalization.
